Navigating multiple new task at once: Learning to create clarity from ambiguity
TLDR when every task is new and unclear, defining outcomes early is the key to making progress and avoiding overwhelm

Lately I found myself juggling multiple Tasked with similar priorities at work, all new, all unrelated, and all due around the same time. Felt a bit overwhelmed with this situation because it was taking me longer to do all these tasks since I feel like I was slow. and feeling that I was slow made me slower
These tasks arranged from writing documentations to working on infrastructure code and preparing internal presentations and reaching out for external team volunteering opportunities. 
challenge that I've noticed is not about the number of task, but the lack of clear structure of outcomes for each other, and that's something I've struggled with both in school and at work.
   When I don't know exactly what don looks like for each piece and what like quality done is like for each piece, it's hard to move forward. 
   I've started addressing this by writing clear statements for each task, breaking them into manageable parts, and building a light system to track where I'm at. It is still early I don't know yet how effective these adjustments will be, 
   but I'm paying close attention. 
   I want to learn how to manage these kinds of high contact switching and ambiguous work periods better and use that insight to build a more sustainable way of working that will both benefit work and school and the long term
