# Cloud_Infrastructure_Notes
This is a repo that contains all my notes of AWS cloud resources and infrastructure from my internship during fall 2024 to winter 2025. 

Any information below does not represent the opinion of the company that I worked for, it also does not contain any confidential information of the team + company that I was in.


I was pretty clueless when I first joined my role here as a AWS dev ops engineering intern. I have not used AWS before nor do I have much knowledge of infrastructure code.

I've learned a lot in my intern role, I believe one consumer rise the main areas of cloud infrastructure into the six areas.

## what is cloud infrastructure?

## why do we/ companies use cloud infra now? and using less on prem?

## how do we build, use, maintain, destroy cloud infrastructure resouces?

## What are the six main areas of cloud infrastructure? With specific examples from AWS.
1. Core infrastructure
2. security and governance
3. data and application management
4. monitoring and optimization
5. specialized areas
6. automation.
