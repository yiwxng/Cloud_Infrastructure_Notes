 # Why this document exist?
 as a part of one of my task to build something for a internal team, I wanted to ask these questions so I can better understand what is it that I'm building and what is the role of this in not only for that team, but the role of tech infrastructure that plays in a financial institution.



## In the simplest term, how does a insurance company generate profit?
Insurance money has a few stream of profits, insurance, investments, and financial advisory.
### 1. Insurance:
Underwriting profit â€“ the difference between the collected premium and what they pay out in claims.
Underwriting profit = total premiums - pay outs - opertional cost

insurances like health, disability, or group solutions, 
1. the customer pay the insurance company, a premium every month or year. 
2. The money is usually invested or hold. 
3. If something bad happens like a sudden sickness, a car crash or anything that they've insured you, the insurance company pay a claim. 
4. And if nothing happens, the insurance company keep the claim. 

### 2. Investment
The money that they collect from premiums, they will invested in government bonds, corporate bonds, real estate, stock, market, and private equity.
These investments will generate interest dividends or capital gains while they wait to pay claims.
