 # Why this document exist?
 as a part of one of my task to build something for a internal team, I wanted to ask these questions so I can better understand what is it that I'm building and what is the role of this in not only for that team, but the role of tech infrastructure that plays in a financial institution.



## In the simplest term, how does a insurance company generate profit?
Insurance money has a few stream of profits, insurance, investments, and financial advisory.

### 1. Insurance:
Underwriting profit – the difference between the collected premium and what they pay out in claims.
Underwriting profit = total premiums - pay outs - opertional cost

insurances like health, disability, or group solutions, 
1. the customer pay the insurance company, a premium every month or year. 
2. The money is usually invested or hold. 
3. If something bad happens like a sudden sickness, a car crash or anything that they've insured you, the insurance company pay a claim. 
4. And if nothing happens, the insurance company keep the claim. 

### 2. Investment
The money that they collect from premiums, they will invested in government bonds, corporate bonds, real estate, stock, market, and private equity.
These investments will generate interest dividends or capital gains while they wait to pay claims.

## Key points in the insurance industry - Accidents and risk don't happen all the time + diversified risk pool
- Insurance is paying a insurance company to take on your or whatever your insurance for financial risk, 

- The insurance industry works because it pools  customer's risk in a population, therefore, The more people that they have the more diverse the risk is – – one person's wrist becomes a drop in the ocean
- they use actual science so a collection of statistic, modelling math understanding the market and forecasting to predict risk better than the average consumer. 
- That allows, the actuarial creates model where the base price of premium is higher than risk, then the underwriters determining whether a person is a suitable candidate for the insurance, and what specific premium to charge. They also diversify the risk by having many.
- An insurance industries and insurance company strategy could be: a positive underwriting profit (they are good at pricing risk and not paying too much claims) or  rely more on investment income and accept smaller underwriting losses

## But how will that impact the insurance industry in a time of catastrophe?
- Increase in premiums, depending on what type of cast catastrophe is the insurance company 
- if severe enough will have to go back to go to cash reserve and/or reinsurance, which is insurance for the insurance company to get more money (where they pay bigger companies like Swiss RE to cover extreme losses)
- small insurance can go bankcrupt 
- Insurance companies should diversify their product, health, life, car, and region

### So does that mean that premiums will always increase and never decrease?
Not true if you are a candidate, where they say that the likelihood of you getting to sickness or accident is less, then you may actually get a deduction in your premium, but generally speaking premiums will increase after system systemic risk

## How does financial hardships, like recession and trade wars impact insurance companies?
 it impact them in two ways, 
 1. investments will fall since the markets will fall, and, depending on what industry they mostly target in it may be affected by a trade war. It may be affected by the industries that's affected in the trade war. 
 2. And customers will come back on on the contributions to their funds or file more claims.
